				<h3>Situation</h3><br>
				<p>we know that Mexico is a nation that will suffer from lack of water. Also, most of the population in Mexico agree with that the public toilets smells bad, some of them are really dirty and it doesn’t cause enough confidence.
				The purpose was to create an ecological alternative of public toilet, improving the experience and guarantee the condition of the object was in optimal conditions in the moment of the interaction.</p>
			</div><br><br>

			<div id="caja2">
				<h3>Task</h3><br>
				<p>My role in this project was create the sanitization system. I focused on the cleaning of the seat, lid, and the duct. The toilet should be sanitized by itself and it should be ready for the next user obtaining their confidence to use it.</p>
			</div><br><br>

			<div id="caja3">
				<h3>Action</h3><br>
				<p>After doing some research, surveys, and brain storming, I had to redesign the toilet modifying the geometry for its easy cleaning, and in the seat, I did a small inclination its function was that the pee could fell into the duct.I decided that the lid would sanitize the seat, it had valves inside it, and they deploy the sanitizing liquid on the seat to cleaning it.
				For a better customer experience, I know that many people don’t want to touch anything in a public toilet, especially the seat and the lid, so, in my design, I put a pedal next to the toilet, it could open the lid without touching it with the hands. When this sanitization system finish it work, there were a kind of screen with a signal indicating when the process finishes, ready for the next user.</p>
			</div><br><br>

				<h3>Results</h3><br>
				<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t develop this project as I would have liked because of the pandemic situation, I did a simulation and I presented it to a group in my faculty, and they share with me their opinion. For the majority, it was awesome, and they would use it.I take a lot of knowledge and experience in the customer experience; I learn the importance of it.</p>
